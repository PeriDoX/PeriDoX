\leveldown{Preliminaries}

\leveldown{Description}

You can use functions inside a \marktool{\toolname} input deck. This means, it is possible to use algebraic expressions, e.g. for the definition of boundary conditions. \toolname{} uses the \href{https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/tree/master/packages/pamgen/rtcompiler}{RTCompiler} function parser to process C-style expressions for the specification of input parameters, including initial and boundary conditions. The RTCompiler (RTC) is used via the \trilinosname{} PG\_RuntimeCompiler class.

\levelstay{History}

The internal mechanism for processing functions used to be \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/muparser/}{muParser}, and was recently changed to rtcompiler, see \href{https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm/commit/02dc1bb21b17e6ed406bf084442541f3723ab368}{this commit}.
