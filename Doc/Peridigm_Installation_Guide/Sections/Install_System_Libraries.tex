\leveldown{Necessary libraries}

Install or update the following system libraries in advance of the \protect\marktool{\toolname} library installation.

% apt-get install zlib1g-dev
\begin{code}
zypper install libbz2-devel
zypper install zlib-devel

zypper install m4

zypper install blas
zypper install lapack
zypper install libX11-devel
\end{code}

\levelstay{Libraries that are not supposed to be installed yet}
\label{sec:System_Libraries_not_to_be_installed_yet}

Open \marktool{\yastname} and go to \textit{Software Management}. In the \textit{Search} field type \marktool{\hdfname} and look whether an older version than the \marktool{\hdfname} version you want to use is already installed on the system.

This is the case if you have \textit{octave-forge-netcdf} installed on your system. If you do not really use this package you can uninstall it in  \marktool{\yastname} together with the installed \marktool{\hdfname} libraries.

If you really need \textit{octave-forge-netcdf} which comes with \marktool{\hdfname}-1.8.15 and have it installed already you can skip the installation of \marktool{\hdfname} described here and change the rest of the installation to use version 1.8.15 of \marktool{\hdfname}.
