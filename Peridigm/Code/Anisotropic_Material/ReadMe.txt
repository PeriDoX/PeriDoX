What?
- energy based damage criterion based on Foster for ordinary and non-ordinary 
- anisotropic material with an arbitrary angles (has to be given in the text file --> Peridigm/Models/Examples/Anisotropy)
- additional stabilization methods
- numerical damping

- Copy all data in the src folder
- compile the Peridigm version

- works for the material Elastic and elastic correspondence
- Implementation description is given in Peridigm_Development_Guide

- Analysis is done in 
  "A MODE-DEPENDENT ENERGY-BASED DAMAGE MODEL FOR PERIDYNAMICS AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION" by Christian Willberg, Lasse Wiedemann and Martin Rädel in 
  Journal of Mechanics of Material and Structures 2018 in review

- Examples are given in Peridigm/Models/Examples
     - works only for xml and yaml

- tested for master 19/03/2021
