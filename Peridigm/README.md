This folder contains code and models specifically for Peridigm: https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm.

We try to incorporate our developments in our Peridigm branch for testing before pushing back to the official Peridigm repository. You can find the development branch at https://github.com/PeriDoX/peridigm.
