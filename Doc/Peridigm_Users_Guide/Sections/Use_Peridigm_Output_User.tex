\levelstay{User-defined output entities}

So called \verb+Compute Class Parameters+ can be defined for the acquisition of result data for nodesets, blocks or the nearest point next to a specific location.

The respective keywords are explained in sections \ref{sec:Peridigm:QRG:ComputeClassParameters:Nodeset},  \ref{sec:Peridigm:QRG:ComputeClassParameters:Block} and \ref{sec:Peridigm:QRG:ComputeClassParameters:NearestPoint}
