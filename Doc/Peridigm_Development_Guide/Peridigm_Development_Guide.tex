% Compilation:
%
% - Automated (Requires arara package):
%   - call: arara Peridigm_Installation_Guide.tex
% - Manual:
%   - pdflatex -> biber -> makeindex/create_glossaries.cmd -> pdflatex -> pdflatex
%   - For compilation add switch -shell-escape in your LaTeX editor:
%     pdflatex --shell-escape -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %source --extra-mem-top=60000000
%   - Compile at least 3 times for proper output
%
% In case of problems:
%
% - Increase Tex-Memory in batch with:
%   initexmf --edit-config-file pdflatex
%   add: main_memory=8000000
%   initexmf --dump=pdflatex
