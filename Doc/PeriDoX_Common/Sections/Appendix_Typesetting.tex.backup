This document was originally typeset using the documentclass \texttt{dlrreprt} from the DLR-internal RM-\LaTeX{} package.

The RM-\LaTeX{} package is not publicly available. Therefore, this document is compatible with a bootstrap-version of the documentclass, called \texttt{bootstrap\_dlrreprt}. \texttt{bootstrap\_dlrreprt} class is part of this repository.

The compilation is performed with \verb+pdflatex+ with the following options:

\begingroup
\lstset{breaklines=true}
\begin{texcode}
pdflatex --shell-escape -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %source  --extra-mem-top=60000000
\end{texcode}
\endgroup

The bibliography is compiled with \verb+biber+.
