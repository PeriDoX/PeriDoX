\levelstay{Create pre-cracks}

See \autoref{sec:Peridigm:QRG:Discretization:Tools:BondFilters}

I suggest you output the variable Number\_Of\_Neighbors in your output file, so that you can confirm that your pre-crack is in the right place.  It always seems to take me multiple tries to get it right.
