\leveldown{Preliminaries}

\toolname{} supports various solver which basically represent different time integration schemes. The solver definition consists of two steps:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Definition of initial and final time
  \item Specification of the time integration scheme
\end{enumerate}

The specification of the time integration scheme is a sublist of parameters in the solver definition.
