\levelstay{Scope}

This document is supposed to be the users guide for the creation of models, performing simulations with \marktool{\toolname} and postprocessing with \marktool{\paraviewname}. It serves as an addition to the original and official user guide \cite{PeridigmUserGuide100}. The open-source version of this document is based upon \cite{DLRPeridigmUserGuide}.

The document includes a growing quick reference guide to model options in \marktool{\toolname} as well as conclusions to obtain proper results. Additionally, preferences and possibilities for the postprocessing of the simulation results with \marktool{\paraviewname} are part of the document.

All informations in this document have been collected to the best of our knowledge from application of or coding in \marktool{\toolname}.

% For all things considering the installation of \marktool{\toolname} and \marktool{\paraviewname} please consult the \marktool{\toolname} Installation Guide which is part of the same repository as this document.
