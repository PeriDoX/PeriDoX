The item requested as \texttt{Variable} must be defined and requested as a global \texttt{Output Variable} in the \texttt{Output} block, e.g.:
In case you request a \texttt{Compute Class Parameter} \textit{Top Reaction Force} with \textit{Variable ``Force''}:

\begin{code}
Compute Class Parameters
  Top Reaction Force
    ...
    Variable "Force"
    Output Label "Top_Reaction_Force"
\end{code}

Than \texttt{Force ``true''} must be defined in the \texttt{Output} section:

\begin{code}
Output
  Output File Type "ExodusII"
  ..
  Output Variables
    Block_Id "false"
    ...
    Force "true"
    Top_Reaction_Force "true"
\end{code}

Without \texttt{Force ``true''} an error is thrown as the group variables cannot be extracted from the global solution.
