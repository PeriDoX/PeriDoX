\levelup{Root .bashrc file}

You usually login as a normal user to \marktool{\opensusename} but changes to the system are performed as root user.

During this installation guide modifications of the .bashrc, a hidden file in the user home directory are requested. For the installation process as root user it is necessary that these modifications also take effect for the root user.

To achieve this a symbolic link is created in the root home directory to the modified .bashrc in the ordinary user directory. To achieve this open a console and perform the following steps

\begin{code}
su %\lstcomment{\# Switch to root user}%
cd %\lstcomment{\# Change to root home}%
ln -sf /home/$USERNAME/.bashrc . %\lstcomment{\# Create symbolic link}%
\end{code}

This way, the root .bashrc file is always an identical copy of the one of the user with the name \verb+$USERNAME+ here.
