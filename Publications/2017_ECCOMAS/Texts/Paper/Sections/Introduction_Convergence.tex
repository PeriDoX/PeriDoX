\subsection{Horizon and convergence}

A main question in PD simulations is the proper choice of the horizon $\delta$ and convergence based on the chosen discretization $h$, cf. \autoref{fig:Peridynamic_convergence}. In its basic paper on the meaning of the horizon explains that the value may be viewed as an effective interaction distance for non-local effects \cite{BobaruF2012}. The PD horizon does not have to be constant over the domain. \cite{AgwaiA2011a} reports that if peridynamics is used to model atomic-scale phenomena, the horizon becomes the cut-off radius of the atomic potential. In the present text an ideally continuous and homogeneous structure is considered, in which the standard local theory applies perfectly until failure. However, we still wish to use peridynamics as a way to model damage and fracture. In this scenario the physics of the interactions between material points do not directly determine the choice of discretization type, size and horizon. \cite{MarangantiR2007} found that the two dominant physical mechanisms that lead to size dependency of elastic behavior at  the nanoscale are surface energy effects and nonlocal  interactions. They estimated the length scales at which the classical model of elasticity breaks down for some real materials. They report that in many materials, the length scale, relevant to forces that determine the bulk properties of materials, far exceeds the interatomic spacing and thus long-range forces contribute to the material behavior. This is particularly true for heterogeneous materials. However, the length scales of interest are still dimensions smaller than the macroscopic behavior investigated in the current context. Thus the question arises: Do discretization, element size and horizon have any influence on the macroscopic failure of the considered structures.
% A convergence study for two types of discretization is carried out to obtain values that describe the current problem adequately.

It has been shown in various publications that the classical continuum mechanics is a subset of peridynamics and that for a horizon striving to zero, the peridynamic theory converges to the local solution of continuum mechanics. According to \cite{BobaruF2012} this is since wave dispersion due to the size of the nonlocality is reduced as the horizon decreases. \cite{ZimmermannM2005} shows the convergence to the local solution for bond-based peridynamics, \cite{EmmrichE2007} for an isotropic linear elastic material and \cite{SillingSA2008} show that the state-based, nonlocal peridynamic stress tensor reduces to the classical local Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor in the limit of a shrinking horizon.

% \end{itemize}

% Horizont:
The convergence of the discretized implementation is a more complex topic compared to the finite element method due to the two independent parameters of element size $dx$ and horizon $\delta$. In \cite{AgwaiA2011a,BobaruF2010} the terms $\delta$- and $m$-convergence were introduced, where $m=\frac{\delta}{dx}$ for uniformly discretized grids. \cite{HaYD2010} also discusses these types of convergence.

Therein it is said that $\delta$-convergence is achieved by fixing $m$ while allowing the horizon  $\delta\rightarrow0$ or increasing $m$ at a slower rate than the decrease in $\delta$. In \cite{SaregoG2016} $\delta$-convergence is described that if the $m$-ratio is kept constant, the solution does not change significantly as the horizon tends to zero. For this type of convergence the numerical peridynamic solution converges to an approximate classical solution.  The larger the value of $m$ is, in other words the smaller the grid spacing $dx$ is, the better the approximation becomes. However, this convergence may not occur in the presence of discontinuities. A non-continuous convergence behavior is expected for the variation of the two factors. \cite{BobaruF2010} points out that convergence is dependent on the computation scheme of nodal amount of volume of all points in horizon of single point. Its calculation is not easy to perform for nodes that are not entirely contained inside the horizon. Simple algorithms lead to non-uniform $m$-convergence.  The proper choice of horizon has to capture the damage types and the main features of the damage evolution processes and should by performed by means of an absolute length scale, independent of the discretization size \cite{HuW2012,SaregoG2016}. A similar observation was found in \cite{FosterJT2011}. The authors tell that $\delta$ should be at least as large as the crack tip plastic process zone, to adequately capture the crack tip physics. Additionally, some experimental intuition may be required to estimate the size of $\delta$ if local measurements are not available.

Multiple specific horizon values are suggested in different publications over the years. $\delta\approx3dx$ and thus $m\approx3$, especially $m\approx3.015$, is the most common value and is used for example in \cite{AgwaiA2011a,SillingSA2005}, \cite{SillingSA2010,DiehlP2016} for micro brittle material, for bond-based composite DCB and ENF specimen \cite{HuYL2015} and for a finite element representation of peridynamics via truss elements \cite{MacekRW2007}. In a convergence study \cite{FreimanisA2017} found $m\approx3$ for tension and additionally $m\approx\sqrt{2}$ for compression specimen to be suitable. It has been found that $m\approx3$ also works well for fracture predictions \cite{SillingSA2005,BobaruF2008}. $m=4$ is applied in \cite{HaYD2011,BobaruF2012} for dynamic crack branching problems in isotropic materials and in \cite{JabakhanjiR2015} for flow through porous medium. Even larger values are used in \cite{HuW2012} for anisotropic materials with $m=5$ and $m=6$ in \cite{SaregoG2016} for linear elastic isotropic material. On the other extreme \cite{ChowdhurySR2016} apply $\delta\approx1.1dx$ for elastic deformation of thin plate in 2D. 

Naturally, the necessity for problem-dependent convergence studies becomes obvious. Examples can be found in \cite{ChenZ2015} for a pitting corrosion problem. \cite{SelesonP2016b} focused on the convergence of numerical solutions of static PD problems to the analytical solutions of those problems under grid refinement for uniform grids, while keeping the horizon fixed. The source achieves first-order convergence for smooth solutions. Higher convergence rates can be achieved through higher-order discretizations, quadrature-based finite difference discretizations with piecewise linear basis functions \cite{TianX2013} or piecewise linear finite element discretizations \cite{ChenX2011, TianX2013, DuQ2013}, which leads to a second-order convergence of numerical solutions in PD problems characterized by smooth solutions.  These higher-order methods, however, significantly increase the complexity of numerical implementations as well as the computational cost of simulations, especially in higher dimensions. \cite{SelesonP2016b} found that achieving convergence is challenging, in particular with respect to the proper choice of horizon. The authors found that, especially in higher dimensions, the horizon cannot be so small as to make computations intractable, but it cannot be too large either as this results in the boundary layer, where displacement boundary conditions are imposed, being the majority of the simulation domain.  \cite{BreitenfeldMS2014} performs convergence studies for a linear elastic static implementation of non-ordinary state-based PD by means of a zero-energy control term. For $\delta m$- \& $\delta$-convergence the authors find, the optimum value increases with increasing mesh size, where the magnitude of the control term increases roughly linearly with the number of degrees of freedom. The $\delta m$-behavior shows first-order convergence independent of the horizon size, whereas the $\delta$-convergence shows approximately half the rate of convergence. Similar findings are reported by \cite{DiehlP2016}. Therein it is stated that choice of the horizon influences heavily the results. The nodal spacing has to shrink faster than the horizon to obtain convergence. Their results suggest that a good nodal spacing can be found for almost all materials for each horizon and vice versa if a small error is acceptable. Unfortunately, no regular pattern was found from which one can determine a simple functional relation between the horizon and the nodal spacing, which makes the choice of a suitable horizon for a given nodal spacing hard.
Somewhat contradictive observations are made in \cite{SaregoG2016}. Therein, the error in 2D linear elasticity state-based PD simulations in which the displacement field is linear is not influenced by $\delta$.%(homogeneous deformation)

A further question is how to discretize numerical implementations in peridynamics. A simple particle-based discretization for the strong form of peridynamic equations was introduced in \cite{SillingSA2005} and is implemented in currently known codes such as EMU and Peridigm. However, \cite{EmmrichE2007b} point out that the governing equations in peridynamics are continuum models and can be discretized in many ways. In \cite{SelesonP2016b} it is mentioned that commonly used meshfree methods in peridynamics suffer from accuracy and convergence issues, due to a rough approximation of the contribution to the internal force density of nodes near the boundary of the neighborhood  of a given node. However they are numerically efficient since  finite element discretizations of governing equations are based on weak forms, which for peridynamic equations double the  number of spatial dimensions that need to be discretized \cite{ChenX2011}.

% Elementgröße
Approximately uniform element sizes are used in most publications. PD in Peridigm does allow for small gradients in element size if the horizon definition is modified appropriately in the block definition. \cite{BobaruF2008} proposes an adaptive refinement algorithm for the non-local method 1D bond-based peridynamics. \cite{ChenZ2016} argues that even if convergence is achieved for an element size, when the discretization grid is refined while using the same horizon, the PD solution may start to depart from the classical one, converging to something other than the
classical solution.
