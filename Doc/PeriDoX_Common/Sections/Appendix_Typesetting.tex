This document was originally typeset using the documentclass \texttt{dlrreprt} from the DLR-internal RM-\LaTeX{} package.

The RM-\LaTeX{} package is not publicly available. Therefore, this document is compatible with a bootstrap-version of the documentclass, called \texttt{bootstrap\_dlrreprt}. \texttt{bootstrap\_dlrreprt} class is part of this repository.

The compilation is performed with \verb+pdflatex+ with the following options:

\begingroup
\lstset{breaklines=true}
\begin{texcode}
pdflatex --shell-escape -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %source --extra-mem-top=60000000
\end{texcode}
\endgroup

The bibliography is compiled with \verb+biber+. The glossary must be compiled with makeindex or, for \windowsosname{}, the included batch-script may be used. The keyword index is created automatically.

The general compilation order is:

\verb+pdflatex+ $\rightarrow$
\verb+biber+ $\rightarrow$
\verb+makeindex+ $\rightarrow$
\verb+pdflatex+ $\rightarrow$
