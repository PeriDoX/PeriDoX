\paragraph{Summary:} \textit{Simulations based on the peridynamic theory are a promising approach to understand the processes involved in matrix failure inside fibre reinforced plastics. Before such complex simulations are carried out, the material behavior of bulk resin material as well as the influence of numerical parameters have to be investigated. In the present text, the linear elastic part of the material response is used to examine the convergence behavior of peridynamic simulations. Possibilities to minimize the effect of different discretization schemes are explored by means of a stochastic material distribution in correlation with scatter found in the material tests regarding the elastic material response and failure patterns. This procedure may also be used to investigate the nature of failure initiation and the robustness of the solution.}
