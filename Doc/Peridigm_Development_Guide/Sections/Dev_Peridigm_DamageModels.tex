\levelstay{Own damage models}

Peridigm is programmed in C++. All the essential vectors and matrices are stored as pointer. It must be noted that no Voigt notation is used. Therefore, the stress and strain matrices are stored in a vector of length 9.
%A sketch of dependencies is shown in \RefFig{fig:MaterialDependencies}.
The file Peridigm\_DamageFactory allows the definition of the material. Here, the name in the .xml datasheet and the corresponding C++ file are defined.
