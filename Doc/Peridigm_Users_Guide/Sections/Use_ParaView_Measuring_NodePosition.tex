\leveldown{Node/point position}

Sometimes it is necessary to get the exact position of a single point or selection of points. The following steps give you these informations and are explained for a selection of points. For an inidividual point some steps can be omitted.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Import the model
  \item Generate and extract the selection of interest according to \autoref{sec:Use_ParaView_Selection}
  \item Display the node/point numbers according to \autoref{sec:Paraview:Display:Point:Labels}
  \item Remember the node/point numbers
  \item In the RenderView select \textit{Split Horizontal}
  \item Create a new SpreadSheet View
  \item In the SpreadSheet View:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Select your selection in the \textit{Showing} combobox
    \item Select \textit{Point Data} in the \textit{Attribute} combobox
    \item The coordinates appear in the \textit{Points} column of the table
    \item In case not all your selected points appear in the table, check if the blocks the points are part of are selected in the \textit{Properties tab} of your selection
  \end{itemize}
  \item Unfortunately the node/point number labels disappear
\end{enumerate}
