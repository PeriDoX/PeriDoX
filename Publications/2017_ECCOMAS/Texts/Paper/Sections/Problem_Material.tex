\subsection{Material properties}

Low viscosity epoxy resin Araldite LY 564 with Aradur 22962 hardener from Huntsman \cite{HuntsmanLY564DataSheet2009} is used. The material properties can be found in \autoref{tab:Material_Properties}.

% For the sake of this study
In order not to complicate the work in the present study, only linear material response and brittle fracture is considered. The material in the peridynamic simulation with Peridigm is performed using the linear peridynamic solid (LPS) material model. It has to be noted that the respective material model does not offer surface correction.
